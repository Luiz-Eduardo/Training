## Linked List

### Description 

A [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) is a data-structure consisting of a finite group of nodes, that together represent a sequence. Each node is basically composed of data (what we are trying to store) and links to the next node (and also the previous, in case of doubly linked lists).
This project consistis of a template class representing a linked list and also some tests for the same structure.

#### Doxygen
This project has a *Doxygen* documentation. In order to generate it, use
```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

### Compiling
Since the language we used was *C++*, you will need `g++` for compiling the code.

In order to use this structure, [download](https://github.com/pauloamed/List.git) it's implementation, here made available.

Once downloaded the implementation, feel free to use it in your project, or test it using our `main.cpp` here provided.

To compile the `main.cpp`  and the structure altogether, execute

```bash
make
```

For cleaning, use

```bash
make clean
```

### Executing
To test, simply execute:
```bash
./test
```
